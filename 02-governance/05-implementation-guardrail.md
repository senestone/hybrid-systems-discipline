File: 02-governance/05-implementation-guardrail.md

Purpose:
  Enforce disciplined implementation strictly derived from approved
  Requirements, Architecture, and Detailed Design artifacts.

Lifecycle authority resides in:
  02-governance/00-lifecycle-bootstrap.md

This guardrail governs execution discipline, traceability preservation,
hybrid boundary enforcement, and scope containment.

Implementation is execution — not redesign.

No phase skipping is permitted.

# 05 — Implementation Guardrail

## 1. Purpose

The Implementation phase translates approved design artifacts into executable software.

Implementation SHALL:

- Execute approved scope only
- Preserve architectural boundaries
- Preserve deterministic–probabilistic containment
- Maintain traceability continuity
- Enforce documentation discipline
- Prepare for verification and packaging alignment

Implementation SHALL NOT:

- Redesign architecture
- Introduce new requirements
- Expand scope
- Collapse modality boundaries
- Bypass traceability controls

Implementation is structural execution under governance control.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Authority

This phase is governed by:

`02-governance/00-lifecycle-bootstrap.md`

Implementation SHALL NOT begin unless:

- SRS is approved
- HLA is approved
- Detailed Design is approved
- Traceability Matrix (RTM) is current
- Test Plan is defined
- Advancement from Detailed Design is authorized

If any artifact is incomplete, implementation is prohibited.

---

## 3. Execution Discipline

Implementation MUST:

- Conform exactly to Detailed Design specifications
- Respect Architectural boundaries
- Implement only approved Requirement IDs
- Maintain structural modularity
- Avoid speculative enhancement
- Avoid premature optimization

If implementation reveals:

- Requirement ambiguity
- Architectural weakness
- Design inconsistency

Work SHALL pause and return to the appropriate lifecycle phase.

Silent correction is prohibited.

---

## 4. Scope Containment

Implementation SHALL NOT:

- Introduce undocumented features
- Add “convenience” behavior
- Perform structural refactoring beyond design scope
- Insert new frameworks or dependencies without requirement constraint
- Expand probabilistic surface area

Scope drift is a governance violation.

All deviations MUST be documented and approved.

---

## 5. Deterministic–Probabilistic Boundary Preservation

If probabilistic components exist, implementation MUST:

- Preserve defined invocation boundaries
- Preserve validation harness logic
- Enforce acceptance/rejection criteria
- Maintain deterministic state protection
- Log probabilistic outputs
- Preserve observability hooks
- Enforce fallback mechanisms

Probabilistic components SHALL NOT:

- Write directly to persistent state without validation
- Bypass deterministic verification layers
- Operate without instrumentation
- Modify system control flow beyond defined contracts

Boundary collapse during implementation is prohibited.

---

## 6. Coding Discipline

Code MUST:

- Reflect design intent precisely
- Maintain modular isolation
- Avoid cross-layer leakage
- Respect interface contracts
- Enforce input validation
- Implement defined error semantics

All code SHALL:

- Follow documented coding standards
- Maintain clarity over cleverness
- Preserve reproducibility posture
- Avoid hidden side effects

Unreviewable code is unacceptable.

---

## 7. In-File Documentation Requirements

Each file MUST include:

- File-level purpose declaration
- Architectural context reference
- Requirement ID references
- Public interface documentation
- Description of non-obvious logic
- Assumption statements
- Constraint declarations

Documentation SHALL support auditability and long-term maintainability.

Undocumented behavior is prohibited.

---

## 8. Traceability Enforcement

Every implemented unit MUST map to:

- Requirement ID
- Architectural Component ID
- Detailed Design reference
- Test Case ID

Traceability SHALL be updated continuously.

RTM gaps SHALL block phase advancement.

Traceability retrofitting after implementation is prohibited.

---

## 9. Test-Aware Development

Implementation MUST align with defined Test Plan.

Code SHALL:

- Be testable
- Support defined unit/integration tests
- Avoid introducing untestable constructs
- Avoid bypassing validation harnesses

Test evasion is prohibited.

Test alignment is mandatory before advancement.

---

## 10. Observability and Auditability

Implementation MUST preserve:

- Logging boundaries
- Error reporting behavior
- Monitoring hooks
- Deterministic replay capability (where applicable)
- Reproducibility posture

Hidden execution paths are prohibited.

---

## 11. Orchestration Alignment

Implementation SHALL:

- Integrate with defined build system
- Respect dependency declarations
- Preserve configuration discipline
- Support defined deployment model
- Avoid environment-specific assumptions unless specified

Build fragility is a governance failure.

---

## 12. Packaging Awareness

Implementation MUST consider:

- Deployment targets
- Runtime dependencies
- Platform constraints
- Configuration management posture
- Distribution reproducibility

Packaging SHALL NOT be deferred.

---

## 13. Refusal Protocol

AI SHALL refuse to:

- Generate code without approved artifacts
- Introduce new scope
- Modify architecture during implementation
- Skip traceability mapping
- Bypass validation layers
- Collapse deterministic–probabilistic containment
- Advance phase without explicit human authorization

Refusal preserves lifecycle integrity.

---

## 14. Completion Criteria

Implementation phase is complete only when:

- All approved Requirement IDs are implemented
- No unauthorized scope exists
- Deterministic–probabilistic boundaries remain intact
- RTM is fully updated
- Test alignment is verified
- Documentation is complete
- Build system executes successfully
- Packaging build succeeds
- Human approval is granted

If any condition is unmet, remain in Implementation.

No transition to Packaging or Validation is authorized without explicit approval.
