Purpose:
  Establish lifecycle authority and enforce disciplined,
  phase-gated progression across hybrid deterministic–probabilistic systems.

This document is the constitutional lifecycle authority for the toolkit.

All guardrails, templates, and platform configurations defer to this document.

This document governs:
- Phase sequencing
- Advancement control
- Rollback authority
- Traceability enforcement
- Packaging and release gating
- Deterministic–probabilistic boundary governance
-->

# Project Lifecycle Bootstrap

This document defines the mandatory lifecycle sequence and enforcement model.

Lifecycle sequencing authority resides here.

Guardrails define phase-specific behavior.  
Templates define structural artifacts.  
Platform configurations enforce behavioral compliance.  

This document defines advancement authority and structural integrity rules.

Explicit human approval is required to advance between phases.

No implicit advancement is permitted.

---

# 1. Authority Hierarchy

The following hierarchy governs lifecycle control:

1. This document (00-lifecycle-bootstrap.md)
2. Guardrails under 02-governance/
3. Lifecycle templates under 04-templates/
4. Platform-specific AI configurations
5. Project-level artifacts

If conflict occurs, defer upward in this hierarchy.

No artifact may override lifecycle sequencing authority.

---

# 2. Mandatory Lifecycle Sequence

Projects SHALL follow this order:

1. Ideation  
2. Requirements (SRS)  
3. High-Level Architecture (HLA)  
4. Detailed Design (DD)  
5. Traceability Consolidation (RTM alignment)  
6. Test Planning and Definition  
7. Implementation  
8. Packaging and Orchestration  
9. Documentation Alignment and Closure  

No phase may be skipped, collapsed, merged, or reordered without explicit human authorization.

---

# 3. Phase Gate Model

Each phase requires:

- Defined objectives
- Defined deliverables
- Defined exit criteria
- Explicit human authorization before advancement

Phase exit without authorization is prohibited.

Release without phase completion is prohibited.

---

# 4. Advancement Rules

The AI agent must:

- Identify current lifecycle phase
- Verify required artifacts exist and are approved
- Confirm RTM alignment where applicable
- Refuse premature advancement
- Surface lifecycle violations explicitly

Silence is not compliance.

Ambiguity requires clarification.

---

# 5. Rollback Authority

If any of the following occur:

- Scope change
- Requirement modification
- Architectural modification
- Design boundary alteration
- Deterministic–probabilistic boundary change
- Packaging change impacting behavior
- Test coverage regression
- RTM traceability gap

Then:

- The lifecycle SHALL roll back to the earliest impacted phase.
- RTM SHALL be updated.
- Decision Log SHALL record the change.
- Human reauthorization SHALL be required.

Untracked structural change is prohibited.

---

# 6. Deterministic–Probabilistic Governance

If probabilistic subsystems exist, the lifecycle SHALL enforce:

- Explicit boundary declaration
- Validation harness specification
- Containment logic definition
- Fallback behavior definition
- Observability controls
- Reproducibility considerations
- RTM boundary mapping

Unbounded probabilistic integration is prohibited.

Containment integrity overrides speed.

---

# 7. Traceability Authority

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is mandatory.

The lifecycle SHALL ensure:

- 100% Requirement coverage
- 100% Architecture mapping
- 100% Design mapping
- 100% Implementation mapping
- 100% Test mapping
- Packaging traceability
- Orchestration traceability

Orphan artifacts block advancement.

Traceability gaps block release.

---

# 8. Testing Authority

Testing SHALL validate:

- All Functional Requirements
- All Critical Non-Functional Requirements
- Failure modes
- Edge conditions
- Deterministic–probabilistic containment
- Clean build reproducibility
- Packaging integrity

Passing tests are mandatory before Packaging.

Testing without traceability is invalid.

---

# 9. Packaging and Release Gating

Before release authorization:

- Clean build reproducibility verified
- Artifact integrity validated
- Version alignment confirmed
- Deterministic–probabilistic containment preserved
- RTM release snapshot finalized
- Documentation aligned

Release without packaging validation is prohibited.

Release without RTM finalization is prohibited.

Release without documentation closure is prohibited.

---

# 10. Documentation Closure

Lifecycle completion requires:

- Updated system documentation
- Updated architecture summary
- Updated packaging details
- Final RTM snapshot
- Formal human approval

Lifecycle is complete only after documentation approval.

---

# 11. Governance Principles

This lifecycle model exists to:

- Prevent architectural drift
- Prevent scope expansion without review
- Preserve traceability
- Enforce reproducibility
- Bound probabilistic systems
- Reduce systemic risk
- Enable audit reconstruction
- Support enterprise-scale delivery

Lifecycle discipline is structural risk management.

---

# 12. Operational Directive

The AI agent SHALL:

- Maintain lifecycle awareness at all times
- Prevent premature progression
- Enforce rollback when required
- Preserve traceability integrity
- Promote reproducibility
- Preserve deterministic–probabilistic containment
- Maintain professional tone
- Refuse shortcuts that violate governance

Governance integrity overrides conversational flow.
